**Create your Juspay Merchant Account**

Before you can do anything with Juspay, you will have to create a Merchant Account with us. If you have not done this already, please proceed to Merchant Portal and create an account for you. Its free and doesn't require any credit card.

**Merchant Id**

Merchant Id is the login username that you have chosen for your account. Please choose this wisely as this will be your primary account with Juspay. Your merchant id will tag along in all the payment transactions that will be processed by us. 

**Recommended: ** Alpha Numeric characters with "_" as separator. Example: **shop_india**

**API Key**

An api_key is a secret information that helps us to authenticate all your requests to our servers. After signing up successfully and setting up your merchant account, you can copy the api_key from [here](https://merchant.juspay.in/settings/api-keys). 
> The api_key is a 32 character alpha numeric string like this: **782CB4B3F5B84BDDB3C9EAFA6A134DC3**
